              <h1>Mission and Vision</h1>

              <p>
                GAMEC is a non-profit 501(c)(3) voluntary membership association
                of organizations, communities, villages and individuals whose
                mission is to be of service to Allah (SWT). Our mission is to
                create a supportive and inclusive environment where Muslim
                Eritreans around the world can connect, collaborate, and thrive.
                We are committed to preserving our rich cultural heritage,
                nurturing strong Islamic values, and building bridges of
                understanding.
              </p>

              <h3>
                As concerned Muslim Eritreans (seniors and youth), we recognize
                the following priorities:
              </h3>
              <ul class="mission">
                <li>
                  Establishing a faith-based (deen) civic association, with a
                  focus on addressing social justice issues in general and
                  particularly within Eritrea.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Bringing together Muslim Eritrean communities to collaborate
                  on a common mission and shared direction.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Helping current Muslim Eritrean communities establish Islamic
                  community centers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Establishing dedicated Islamic Youth, Women, Senior and
                  Professional Associations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Strengthening our Islamic knowledge by connecting with Muslim
                  scholars and Eritrean sheikhs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Connecting and working with other Islamic Organizations for
                  the greater good of our deen.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Establishing a relief and development organization to help
                  those in need inside Eritrea and refugees around the world.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Organizing dialogue events to show the need of interfaith
                  dialog and outreach between Muslims and Non-Muslims.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <h3>
                We believe that diversity is a divine <u>blessing</u>, and as Muslims,
                working together toward a common goal (Islam) is the key to our <u>success</u>.
              </h3>
              <p>
                By embracing our heritage, values, and a shared commitment to
                positive change, we endeavor to build a more united, resilient,
                and harmonious Muslim Eritrean community.
