              <p>
                The GAMEC Sisters program, a vital initiative within GAMEC,
                focuses on empowering women of all backgrounds through Islamic
                education and support. Our mission is to provide platforms for
                sisters to explore and strengthen their faith within their
                communities. We aim to represent the diversity of Muslim women
                around the world, fostering inclusivity across ages, genders,
                ethnicities, and economic backgrounds. By expanding membership
                and embracing diversity, we strive to become a leading
                institution, utilizing technology and collaboration to support
                our vision of spiritual growth and community engagement among
                sisters.
